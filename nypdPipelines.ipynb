        "### **Introduction**\n",
        "For our project, since we are dealing with a dataset provided by the New York Police Department, we have decided to come up with the following question: \n",
        "> \n",
        "__Are we able to predict the age of the Complainant?__\n",
        "> \n",
        "This question is a Regression problem because we are predicting continuous, real values: a person's age. \n",
        "Our target variable will be the age of the complainant (\"complainant_age_incident\"), and our evaluation metrics will be R^2 and the Root Means Squared Error (RMSE).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Baseline Model**\n",
        "For our baseline model, we decided to add 3 features from the dataset: the officer's age (Quantitative), officer's gender (Nominal), and complainant's gender (Nominal), in order to predict the complainant's age. \n",
        "> \n",
        "Our baseline model's R^2 was ~1.64%, and the RMSE was ~11.95. These results at first glance don't look good, but with our Final Model we can further compare if these values are truly good or not good.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Final Model**\n",
        "For our Final Model, we went ahead and added two new engineered features. We decided to apply two different types of transformers on the officer age column: A Standardizer (z-scaler), and a Binarizer that approximately differs between old and young age. By applying these transformers, we can see just how important the officer age column is to our predictions, by applying two different transformers on it. \n",
        "> \n",
        "We have chosen a DecisionTreeRegressor, because this regressor model uses decision trees to fit the patterns in the data, proving that decision trees are definitely not restricted to just Classification problems. They also provide a handful of parameters to test combinations in a Grid Search. Upon running a grid search on 4 parameter variables from DecisionTreeRegressor, we found that the best parameter combination was: {'max_depth':13, 'min_samples_leaf':2, 'min_samples_split':2, 'max_leaf_nodes':40}. In terms of model selection, we decided on two; either LinearRegression or DecisionTreeRegressor. We ultimately went with DecisionTreeRegressor because we knew that this would provide us with the flexibility of multiple parameter combinations, in order to run GridSearchCV.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Fairness Evaluation**\n",
        "For our Fairness Evaluation, we wanted to look at the subset of old officers vs young ones using a permutation test. We used the difference in R^2 values as a parity measure because we are looking at a regression question as opposed to a classification one. This works as an accuracy parity measure because this allows to check that the classifier is performing equally well among the two groups. With the threshold being 30 years old, we separated the subsets into old officers and young ones. The Null Hypothesis was that the model is fair and that the R^2 values of the two groups are similar. The Alternate Hypothesis was that the model is unfair as the R^2 values would not be close to each other. After running the permutation test with 100 repetitions and setting the significance level at 0.05, we failed to reject the Null Hypothesis as we obtained a P-value of about 0.42 and 0.42 > 0.05. This leads us to believe that the model we have created is fair when looking at the subset of the two different age groups of officers."
